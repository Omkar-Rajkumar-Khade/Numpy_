# Python Numpy

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.


## Main Features

- It provides a powerful N-dimensional array object
- It provides sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- It provides tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- It provides useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
